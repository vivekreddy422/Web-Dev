            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>I am Vivek. I am pursuing Masters in Information Technology. Hi, I am Vivek. I was born and brought up in Hyderabad. I graduated from Manipal University, Manipal. After graduation, I worked as an application development analyst at Accenture, Pune for 20 months where I contributed my coding and automation testing skills to develop an Enterprise File Exchange application (a banking app) . I wanted a different career path. So I chose to pursue a career in Machine Learning. So, I had decided to pursue Masters at IIIT Hyderabad. I play badminton and follow Formula1 racing. I like how the teams adapt to the quick changes made by F1. Even now, I learn to be as adaptive and as flexible as I can be. One day, my goal is to write the best compression algorithm with the least file size.</p>
